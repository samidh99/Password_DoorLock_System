An Embedded System Design project performed using LPC2378. ( https://www.nxp.com/docs/en/data-sheet/LPC2377_78.pdf ) 

This repository is a project file that can be imported into Keil uvision. 

The functional code is contained in Blinky.c (Language: Embedded C)

Functionality:
* The user enters a password using a keypad. 
* If there is a match, then the door unlocks. 
* An option is provided to the user to lock the door after the door is shut.
* A servo motor is being used to control the mechanical movements of the practical door latch.
